This is the LGPL runtime from the SmartClient(tm) Ajax RIA system, a truly
outstanding Javascript framework. See http://www.smartclient.com/ for
information about the framework.

This is not the official distribution from Isomorphic Software ... you should
go to http://www.smartclient.com/ for that. Instead, this is just a convenience
for my deployment of SmartClient(tm) based apps via git submodules.

Here is a quick list of changes, as compared with the official distribution.

1. I have only included the parts that are redistributable under the LGPL.
   The official download (even the LGPL version) has much useful documentation,
   an example server, etc., so you really want that instead of this.

2. This is essentially, then, the contents of smartclientRuntime/isomorphic
   from the official distribution, with the following changes.

3. I moved the "client" directory from the smartclientSDK/source directory here, since
   that directory is also under the LGPL, and it is sometimes useful to use it
   to step through un-minified code. For production use, you want system/, of
   course.

4. I added some symlinks in client/schema because the code seemed to want to
   download the files with ".js" at the end.

Let me repeat that to actually figure this out, you really need to get the official
distribution ... this is just a convenience for deployment via git submodules.

Here is the license, for the record, as copied from the official distribution.
